# Welcome
This is the GitHub repository for the Hummingbird rendering engine, developed solely by me, SantaClausNL.

JavaScript's Canvas API is great, but also very slow. Therefore I decided to make this, a fast and simple framework for WebGL.

This has been a great learning experience for me, in terms of Git(Hub), OpenGL and general graphics programming.
