# Welcome
This is the GitHub repository for the Hummingbird game engine, the engine is being developed solely by me, SantaClausNL.
The engine came about as a result of the JavaScript Canvas API being very slow (see my framework for that [here](https://github.com/SantaClausNL/Pelican)), so I needed a better option for a reasonably demanding game I'm working on.
This came in the form of WebGL, all the benefits of the Web, and fast graphics performance.
